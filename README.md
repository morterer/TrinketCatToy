# Trinket Cat Toy
A cat toy that moves a laser pointer in random directions, at random speeds.  The code chooses a random speed and position for each servo.  Each servo is moved to the target position, at the desired speed.  When the servos reach their target position, new positions and speeds are randomly chosen, and the process repeats.
